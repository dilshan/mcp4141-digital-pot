The main objective of this project is to create a prototype version of a digital potentiometer using *Microchip*'s MCP4141 IC. MCP4141 is available with end-to-end resistances of 5K立, 10K立, 50k立, and 100K立. This potentiometer-module can drive MCP4141 with any of the above mention resistances.

To drive the MCP4141, this module use ATtiny13 MCU. This MCU control MCP4141's resistance, based on the rotary-encoder events. ATtiny13 is an 8-pin, low power 8-bit MCU with an internal oscillator. The key reason to pick this MCU is its availability and lower price. Due to a lack of hardware-based SPI, this system use bit-banging SPI implementation to drive the MCP4141 IC.

To reduce the board size, this module employs only 3 components. Which including ATtiny13, MCP4141, and rotary-encoder. The dimension of the PCB design given for this module is 26.16mm x 29.72mm. 

## Building and flash firmware

Firmware of this module is developed using AVR-GCC toolchain. To build the firmware execute the `make` command.

To flash the compiled firmware, use the following set of commands:

    make fuse
    make flash

The `make fuse` command can use to set up the fuse-bits of the MCU and it needs to execute only once.
